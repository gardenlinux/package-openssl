Subject: [PATCH 073/125] Fix line continuation check in config parser

Fixes #8038: Previously, line continuation logic did not account for the 'again' flag, which could cause incorrect removal of a backslash character in the middle of a line. This fix ensures that line continuation is correctly handled only when 'again' is false, thus improving the reliability of the configuration parser.
